# Verification Before Done Doctor

## Purpose

Use this doctor when a bot cannot identify a verification gate, a check fails, evidence is ambiguous, output is stale, or the user asks whether a task is truly complete.

## Fast triage

1. Restate the exact symptom or uncertainty.
2. Confirm current repo/runtime/task state from live evidence.
3. Check whether the wrong skill, stale path, missing prerequisite, missing approval, or missing credential is the real blocker.
4. Inspect the smallest relevant log, diff, status output, config, or source file.
5. Choose the smallest safe recovery step.
6. Verify recovery with the same signal that exposed the problem.
7. Report remaining risk or escalation clearly.

## Stop conditions

Stop, ask, or escalate when:

- The requested action would run destructive verification against production without approval.
- The requested action would invent test results or treat stale output as current evidence.
- The requested action would claim full coverage when only a smoke test was run.
- If no meaningful check can run, state why and mark the remaining risk.
- Ownership, permissions, production blast radius, or data sensitivity is unclear.

## Evidence to collect

- exact request or failure symptom
- relevant file, repo, service, task, or channel
- current status/diff/log excerpt with secrets redacted
- suspected cause
- safe recovery option
- verification result after recovery

## Doctor report format

```text

## Recovery verification

Do not report recovery from intent alone. Re-run the smallest relevant check, inspect the changed state, and state exactly what passed or what remains blocked.
