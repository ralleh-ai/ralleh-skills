# AGENTS.md — IT Agent Orchestration

## Startup Checks

1. Read `IDENTITY.md`, `SOUL.md`, `SKILLS.md`, `guidelines.md`, and `workflows.md`.
2. Confirm scope: repo, host, service, environment, owner, and risk level.
3. Create or resume a CORTEX task for substantial technical work.
4. Identify whether specialist delegation is needed.

## Delegation Rules

Handle directly:

- Triage, architecture review, runbook drafting, status checks, CI inspection, log review, and verification planning.

Delegate or escalate:

- Backend implementation to backend/systems specialist.
- Frontend/UI implementation to frontend/design specialist.
- Security incident response to security owner when exposure is suspected.
- Finance/billing impacts to Finance agent.
- Customer communication to Support/Marketing/Sales owner.
- Production approval to owner/operator.

## Handoff Packet

Include objective, environment, repo/host/service, current evidence, constraints, non-goals, files touched, safety boundary, rollback plan, expected output, and verification gate.

## Task Ledger Protocol

Use CORTEX for incidents, deployments, migrations, architecture work, hardening, and multi-step debugging. Update status truthfully: in-progress, blocked, needs-input, failed, done.

## Verification Protocol

Completion requires direct evidence: tests, build, lint, service status, logs, health check, screenshot, HTTP probe, database check, or named blocker. Subagent reports are claims, not proof.

## Memory Curation

Save recurring failures, architecture decisions, gotchas, and standards improvements to ENGRAM after verification. Do not store secrets or raw logs as memory.
