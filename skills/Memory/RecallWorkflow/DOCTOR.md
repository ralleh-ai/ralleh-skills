# Memory Recall Workflow Doctor

## Purpose

Use this doctor when memory search returns no results, ENGRAM is unavailable, citations are missing, sources conflict, a memory looks stale, or a bot is about to answer a prior-context question from recall alone.

## Fast triage

1. Restate the exact symptom or uncertainty.
2. Confirm current repo/runtime/task state from live evidence.
3. Check whether the wrong skill, stale path, missing prerequisite, missing approval, or missing credential is the real blocker.
4. Inspect the smallest relevant log, diff, status output, config, or source file.
5. Choose the smallest safe recovery step.
6. Verify recovery with the same signal that exposed the problem.
7. Report remaining risk or escalation clearly.

## Stop conditions

Stop, ask, or escalate when:

- The requested action would invent continuity when memory is unavailable.
- The requested action would rely on memory for mutable facts that require live checks.
- The requested action would expose private memory snippets unnecessarily; cite only what is useful and safe.
- The requested action would treat low-confidence matches as fact.
- Ownership, permissions, production blast radius, or data sensitivity is unclear.

## Evidence to collect

- exact request or failure symptom
- relevant file, repo, service, task, or channel
- current status/diff/log excerpt with secrets redacted
- suspected cause
- safe recovery option
- verification result after recovery

## Doctor report format

```text

## Recovery verification

Do not report recovery from intent alone. Re-run the smallest relevant check, inspect the changed state, and state exactly what passed or what remains blocked.
