# Task Handoff and Status Reporting Doctor

## Purpose

Use this doctor when a task cannot be resumed, status conflicts with repo/service state, an agent disappears, a handoff lacks evidence, or a user asks what is done versus blocked.

## Fast triage

1. Restate the exact symptom or uncertainty.
2. Confirm current repo/runtime/task state from live evidence.
3. Check whether the wrong skill, stale path, missing prerequisite, missing approval, or missing credential is the real blocker.
4. Inspect the smallest relevant log, diff, status output, config, or source file.
5. Choose the smallest safe recovery step.
6. Verify recovery with the same signal that exposed the problem.
7. Report remaining risk or escalation clearly.

## Stop conditions

Stop, ask, or escalate when:

- The requested action would omit blockers or pretend uncertainty is resolved.
- The requested action would include secrets, private data, or irrelevant logs in a handoff.
- The requested action would forward raw internal metadata as a user update.
- The requested action would mark done without verification evidence or a named reason verification could not run.
- Ownership, permissions, production blast radius, or data sensitivity is unclear.

## Evidence to collect

- exact request or failure symptom
- relevant file, repo, service, task, or channel
- current status/diff/log excerpt with secrets redacted
- suspected cause
- safe recovery option
- verification result after recovery

## Doctor report format

## Recovery verification

Do not report recovery from intent alone. Re-run the smallest relevant check, inspect the changed state, and state exactly what passed or what remains blocked.
